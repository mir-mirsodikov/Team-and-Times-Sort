    ##Project functionality:
        * The user will take a PDF of 'Top Times' from http://www.kshsaa.org/Public/Swimming/Main.cfm
            * This PDF file will then be turned into a text file using an online formatter
        * The text file will then be moved to the directory
        * The script will run through the text file and get rid of all of the 6A schools leaving 1-5A
        * This information will then be written to a seperate text file
        * Instead of everything being in a text file, put it all in a Google Sheet using gspread

    ##Future goals:
        * Automate the process of downloading the PDF file and then converting it to a text file
        * Allow the user to type in the name of the text file they want to write to
        * Put in general meet results and then do:
            - Allow user to type in name of team
            - Have the script read through the file and compile all of the results from that team
            - Keep a log of the top times from that team and update it when a new meet result comes out
